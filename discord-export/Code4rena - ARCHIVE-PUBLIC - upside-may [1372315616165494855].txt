👋 Hello and welcome to the $13,000 **Upside** audit channel!

📆 Audit opens Monday, 19 May 2025 20:00 (20:00 UTC) and runs through Monday, 26 May 2025 20:00 (20:00 UTC) (7 days).

Please give a warm welcome to the Upside team, particularly @Steve, @Umar and @Zachary Dash, who will be available for questions via private threads, in the BST/CDT timezone(s). 

Two important notes for this audit: 
1. ❗**A coded, runnable PoC is required** for all High/Medium submissions to this audit. 
   - Exception: PoC is optional (though recommended) for wardens with signal ≥ 0.68
   - PoCs **must** use the test suite provided in the audit repo.
   - The audit repo includes a basic PoC template to run the test suite.
   - Your submission will be marked as Insufficient if the POC is not runnable and working with the provided test suite..
2. 🤖 **Documentation bot** is *not* available for this audit, as there is no written documentation at this time. Wardens are strongly recommended to review the code walk-through linked in the audit repo `README` to understand the codebase.
3. C4's new audit channel rules are in effect - please see https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810929015509483554/1372881856898273340 if you missed the announcement. 

We'll be posting relevant links, documentation, etc. here, so if you intend to participate in this audit, consider enabling notifications for this channel. 🐺 ⏰

Good morning everyone! I thought I would answer some common questions in public to avoid repeating

We are planning to deploy only on base.

The liquidity token is intended to always be USDC however the tokenize fee can be in any ERC20 token we have vetted and approved

I'm not sure if this was already shared but we do have a code walkthrough which might help explain some design decisions etc

Since several wardens have asked whether Foundry PoCs are acceptable: the Upside team would prefer Hardhat wherever possible.

ℹ️  Regarding the Mandatory POC requirement, the readme has been updated: 
- PoCs **must** use the test suite provided in the audit repo.
- Your submission will be marked as Insufficient if the POC is not runnable and working with the provided test suite.

This update will apply to submissions for the Upside audit moving forward, so please ensure your PoC is functional in the provided test suite before submitting your findings from this point on.
